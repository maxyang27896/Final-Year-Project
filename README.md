# Final-Year-Project
Optimal control and its role in cancer treatment

## Content
The following codes contain the solution to the optimal control problem of a nonlinear mathematical cancer model. Four methods have been applied to the same model, Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR), State Dependent Riccati Equation (SDRE), a dynamic control law and Direct Collocation. The dynamic control law is the key focus of this project which provides a optimised control strategy than LQR and SDRE and is a more robust control algorithm than direct collocation.
