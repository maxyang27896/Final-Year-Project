# Final-Year-Project
Optimal control and its role in cancer treatment

## Content
The following codes contain the solution to the optimal control problem of a nonlinear mathematical cancer model. Four methods have been applied to the same model, 
- Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR)  
- State Dependent Riccati Equation (SDRE)  
- Dynamic Control Law  
- Direct Collocation.    

The dynamic control law is the key focus of this project which provides an optimised control strategy that is superior to the LQR and SDRE performance and more robust than direct collocation. Direct collocation is a numerical optimisation approach of solving the optimal control problem and has been used to demonstrate the optimality of this dynamic control law.
