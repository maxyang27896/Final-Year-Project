# Final-Year-Project
Optimal control and its role in cancer treatment

## Content
The following codes contain the solution to the optimal control problem of a nonlinear mathematical cancer model. Four methods have been applied to the same model, 
- Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR)  
- State Dependent Riccati Equation (SDRE)  
- a dynamic control law  
- Direct Collocation.    

The dynamic control law is the key focus of this project which provides a optimised control strategy than LQR and SDRE and is a more robust control algorithm than direct collocation. Direct collocation is a numerical optimisation approach of solving the optimal control problem and has been used to demonstrate the optimality of this dynamic control law.
